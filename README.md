# Sort_Program
## This program is part of COT 5405 Design & Analysis Of Algorithms course. 

### Algorithms Design Project to support Sorting Module.

**Step 1.**  Write a program module to create  500 ( code so that the size of the arrays is easy to change) element integer arrays.  Your program should create 3 separate arrays with the following contents.

        Array 1:  Create a sorted array  (integers stored in ascending order)  [Best Case]

        Array 2: Create an unsorted array (integers stored in descending order)  [worst case]

        Array 3 :  Create an unsorted array (integers stored in random order with no duplication)  [Average case]

Sorting Project

**Step 2.**  Implement each of the following sort algorithms

        Bubble sort (poor version)          

        Bubble sort (smart version)

        Insertions sort

        Selection sort

        Merge sort

        Quick sort

 

**Step 3.**   Run each algorithm using each of the 3 array options (remember data must be returned to itâ€™s initial state after each sort.
Count the number of exchanges made by each algorithm for each option.
Print the results in tabular form.
